# Guilloche

![screenshot](/screenshot.png?raw=true "A top-down view of a maze, with cyclopean squares moving through it. One of them has it's eye wide open, staing at the viewer.")

A game or whatever that as of yet is still finding itself.

# Building/Running

1. If you haven't already, [install Rust/Cargo](https://rustup.rs/).
2. Try running `cargo run`. If that starts up the placeholder/demo, you're set.
3. If you got an error, refer to the instructions for [raylib-rs](https://github.com/deltaphc/raylib-rs#installation). Some libraries/utilities may need ot be installed. Eventually `cargo run` should work. That said as of this writing, I have only tested on Windows and Linux.
