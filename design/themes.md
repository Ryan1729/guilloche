# Potential Themes

* Use herringbone wang / complete stochastic set tile generation. See [here](https://nothings.org/gamedev/herringbone/index.html).

* Gameplay is about obtaining knowledge.
    * Doing science?
        * Player or player character? Player seems better.
        * A scientist theme is also hard to start with. How about just doing favours for NPCs first?
            * Knowledge can be about how best to navigate the generated space. Maybe don't take on some favours since the trek would be unreasonable?
            * Treasure maps too.
                * Can we make naviagtion with only a static map without a player on it interesting?
                * Take inspiration from Malachite Dreams? See [here](http://www.zincland.com/7drl/explore/).

* Making animations with a state machine currently seems fun. Maybe do more of that?            

* Cyclic level generation, like Unexplored? [An article on it](https://www.gamedeveloper.com/disciplines/unexplored-s-secret-cyclic-dungeon-generation-).
    * Maybe use that for puzzle generation, as opposed to actual traversal.
        * That is, allow entering any room, but lock interior doors via these puzzles.
